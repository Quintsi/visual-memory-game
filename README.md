Visual Memory Game

!) Set the slider to the desired size - the larger the grid the harder the game is
2) Enter the amount of squares that will flash white for you to memorize
3) After three seconds, take your guess at where all the, now hidden, squares are
4) With three wrong guesses, you lose. Guess all the squares correctly, you win.

I built this to have a more user customizable variant of the human bench mark visual memory game.
